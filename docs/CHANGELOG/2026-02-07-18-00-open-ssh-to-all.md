# Open SSH access to 0.0.0.0/0

**Date**: 2026-02-07 18:00:00

## Summary

Hardcode SSH ingress to `0.0.0.0/0` so any team member with the key can deploy without re-running Terraform.

## Changes

- Modified: `infrastructure/terraform/environments/dev/ec2.tf` — SSH CIDR changed from `var.ssh_allowed_cidr` to `"0.0.0.0/0"`
- Removed: `ssh_allowed_cidr` variable from `variables.tf`
- Modified: `Makefile` — removed `-var="ssh_allowed_cidr=..."` from `infra` and `infra-destroy` targets
- Modified: `scripts/setup-production.sh` — removed IP detection step and `-var="ssh_allowed_cidr=..."` from terraform apply

## Affected Components

- `infrastructure/terraform/environments/dev/` - Security group SSH rule now open to all IPs
- `Makefile` - Simplified infra targets
- `scripts/setup-production.sh` - Removed SSH CIDR detection step, renumbered steps
